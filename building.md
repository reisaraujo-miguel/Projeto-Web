## Inside the `frontend` folder, you can run several commands:

### npm install
- installs all development dependencies

### npm start
- Starts the development server.

### npm run build
- Bundles the app into static files for production.

### npm test
- Starts the test runner.

## We suggest that you begin by typing:
- `cd frontend` to enter the app folder
- `npm install` to download the dependencies
- `npm start` to start the app
